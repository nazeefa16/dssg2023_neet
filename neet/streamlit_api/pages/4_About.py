    st.markdown('Between 2018 and 2020, Buckinghamshire county had a NEET rate of above 2% and Unknown destination rate of above 5% for young people aged 17 to 18.')

    st.markdown('Studies have shown that time spent NEET can have a detrimental effect on physical and mental health, increasing the likelihood of unemployment, low wages, or low quality of work later on in life. Buckinghamshire Council wanted to identify studentsâ€™ risk of becoming NEET in years 12 or 13 (ages 17-18), by the end of years 10 or 11 (ages 14-16) so that they could target the right pupils with early intervention programmes. It is hoped that doing so will improve the life chances of those young people who receive intervention that they otherwise may not have done.')
